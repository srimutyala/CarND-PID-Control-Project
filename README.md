# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project we revisit the lake race track from the Behavioral Cloning Project. This time, however, we implemented a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!

Project considerations & requirements

The PID controller implementtaion closely follows the lecture notes where possible and improvise while dealing with the hyperparamter tuning and initilization.

Controller

The controller consists of 3 different control setups, the P, I & D.
